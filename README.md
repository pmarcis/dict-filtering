**Giza++ Dictionary Filtering Tool** and **Transliteration Dictionary Acquisition Tool**

If you are looking for filtered **Giza++ dictionaries** for European languages, you can download them from [META-SHARE](http://metashare.tilde.com/repository/search/?q=giza%2B%2B+dictionaries). If you have issues finding them, drop me a message (will see what we can do).

If you are looking for the **Multilingual Transliteration dictionary**, you can download it from [here](Data).
